**Status**: Research (informational)

## Summary

Claude Code sandboxing uses OS-level primitives to enforce filesystem and network
isolation on bash commands. This replaces approval fatigue with automated
enforcement — commands that stay within sandbox boundaries run without prompts.

**Both layers required**: Without network isolation, a compromised agent could
exfiltrate files (e.g., SSH keys). Without filesystem isolation, it could
backdoor system resources to gain network access.

## Platform Support

| Platform | Mechanism | Setup |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| macOS | Seatbelt (built-in) | Works out of the box |
| Linux/WSL2 | bubblewrap + socat | `make setup_sandbox` or `sudo apt-get install bubblewrap socat` |
| WSL1 | Not supported | bubblewrap requires WSL2 kernel features |
| Windows | Not supported | Planned |

## Example Configuration

From `.claude/settings.json`:

```json
"sandbox": {
  "enabled": true,
  "autoAllowBashIfSandboxed": true,
  "allowUnsandboxedCommands": false,
  "enableWeakerNestedSandbox": false,
  "network": {
    "allowLocalBinding": true,
    "allowedHosts": ["api.github.com"]
  },
  "filesystem": {
    "write": {
      "allowOnly": ["/tmp/claude-1000", ".git"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Key choices:**

- [x] Sandbox enabled with auto-allow
- [x] Unsandboxed escape hatch disabled (`allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`)
- [x] Weaker nested sandbox disabled
- [x] Network restricted to `api.github.com` only
- [x] Filesystem writes restricted to `/tmp/claude-1000` and `.git`
- [ ] `raw.githubusercontent.com` not in `allowedHosts` — needed if fetching
  raw GitHub content
- [ ] No `allowedDomains` for PyPI/npm — package install commands must run
  outside sandbox or with `excludedCommands`

Setup on Linux/WSL2:

```bash
sudo apt-get install bubblewrap socat
```

Or via a Makefile recipe if your project defines one. Not typically bundled with
the default dev setup — must be run separately.

## Configuration Reference

### Core Settings

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `sandbox.enabled` | Enable bash sandboxing | `false` |
| `sandbox.autoAllowBashIfSandboxed` | Auto-approve sandboxed bash commands | `true` |
| `sandbox.excludedCommands` | Commands that bypass sandbox entirely | — |
| `sandbox.allowUnsandboxedCommands` | Allow `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` escape hatch | `true` |

### Filesystem

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `sandbox.filesystem.allowWrite` | Additional writable paths |
| `sandbox.filesystem.denyWrite` | Paths blocked from writing |
| `sandbox.filesystem.denyRead` | Paths blocked from reading |

**Defaults**: Write to CWD and subdirectories only. Read entire filesystem
except explicitly denied paths.

### Network

| Key | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `sandbox.network.allowedDomains` | Domains allowed for outbound traffic (supports wildcards) |
| `sandbox.network.allowManagedDomainsOnly` | Only allow managed domains; block others silently |
| `sandbox.network.allowUnixSockets` | Specific Unix socket paths to allow |
| `sandbox.network.allowAllUnixSockets` | Allow all Unix socket connections |
| `sandbox.network.allowLocalBinding` | Allow binding to localhost ports (macOS only) |
| `sandbox.network.httpProxyPort` | HTTP proxy port |
| `sandbox.network.socksProxyPort` | SOCKS5 proxy port |

### Security-Reducing Options

| Key | Description | Default |
| --- | ----------- | ------- |
| `enableWeakerNestedSandbox` | Weaker sandbox for unprivileged Docker (Linux/WSL2) | `false` |
| `enableWeakerNetworkIsolation` | Allow system TLS trust service (macOS) for `gh`, `gcloud`, `terraform` | `false` |

### Path Prefix Conventions

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
| ------ | ------- | ------- |
| `//` | Absolute from filesystem root | `//tmp/build` → `/tmp/build` |
| `~/` | Relative to home directory | `~/.kube` → `$HOME/.kube` |
| `/` | Relative to settings file directory | `/build` → `$SETTINGS_DIR/build` |

### Array Merging Across Scopes

When `allowWrite`, `denyWrite`, or `denyRead` are defined in multiple settings
scopes (managed, user, project, local), arrays **merge** (concatenate +
deduplicate) rather than replace. No scope can accidentally remove another
scope's entries.

## How It Works

### Filesystem Isolation

Enforced at OS level (Seatbelt on macOS, bubblewrap on Linux/WSL2). Restrictions
apply to **all subprocess commands** — `kubectl`, `terraform`, `npm`, not just
Claude's own file tools.

### Network Isolation

Controlled through a **proxy server running outside the sandbox**. Only approved
domains pass through. Unapproved domain requests trigger permission prompts
(unless `allowManagedDomainsOnly` auto-blocks them).

### Escape Hatch

When a command fails due to sandbox restrictions, Claude may retry with
`dangerouslyDisableSandbox`. These go through the normal permission flow. Disable
with `allowUnsandboxedCommands: false`.

### Two Sandbox Modes

**Auto-allow** (`/sandbox`): Sandboxed bash commands run without prompts.
Unsandboxable commands fall back to regular permission flow.

**Regular permissions**: All bash commands go through standard permission flow
even when sandboxed. More control, more approvals.

## Relationship to Skills

Skills (`.claude/skills/`) are not explicitly addressed in sandbox docs.
Based on architecture:

- Skill instructions are processed by the model — not subject to sandbox
- Bash commands **executed by** a skill go through the sandboxed bash tool
- File read/edit operations by skills follow permission rules
- The `allowed-tools` frontmatter restricts which tools a skill can invoke,
  complementing sandbox restrictions

## Security Model

### What Sandbox Protects Against

- Modification of critical config files (`~/.bashrc`, `/bin/`)
- Data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers
- Malicious dependency scripts (npm postinstall, etc.)
- Prompt injection via compromised build tools
- Unauthorized API calls

### Known Limitations

| Limitation | Risk | Mitigation |
| ---------- | ---- | ---------- |
| No traffic inspection | Allowed domains can carry any payload | Only allow trusted domains |
| Domain fronting | Broad domains (e.g., `github.com`) may enable exfiltration | Use specific subdomains |
| Unix socket escalation | Docker socket grants host access | Avoid `allowAllUnixSockets` |
| Broad `allowWrite` | Write to `$PATH` dirs enables privilege escalation | Restrict to project dirs |
| Weaker nested sandbox | Considerably weakens security in unprivileged Docker | Keep disabled unless externally isolated |

### Incompatible Commands

- `watchman` (used by `jest`) — use `jest --no-watchman`
- `docker` — add to `excludedCommands`

## Additional Security Features (Non-Sandbox)

| Feature | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Command blocklist | `curl` and `wget` blocked by default |
| Isolated WebFetch | Separate context window prevents prompt injection via web |
| Trust verification | First-time codebase runs require trust confirmation |
| Command injection detection | Suspicious bash commands require manual approval |
| Fail-closed matching | Unmatched commands default to requiring approval |
| Secure credential storage | API keys encrypted at rest |

## Open Source Sandbox Runtime

The sandbox runtime is available as a standalone npm package:

```bash
npx @anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime <command-to-sandbox>
```

Source: [github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime](https://github.com/anthropic-experimental/sandbox-runtime)

Enables sandboxing outside Claude Code, including MCP servers.
