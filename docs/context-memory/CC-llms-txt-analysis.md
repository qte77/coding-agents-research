**Status**: Stable (spec analysis + 651-page Anthropic index + example project implementation)

## Summary

[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is a curated markdown index file served at a
site's root, designed for AI agents to discover project documentation at
inference time. It solves the context-window problem: websites have too much
HTML/JS/nav boilerplate for LLMs to process efficiently.

A project can implement llms.txt via GitHub workflows and a curated template (see example below).

## Specification (llmstxt.org)

### Required Structure

```markdown
# Title                              <- REQUIRED (only mandatory element)

> Optional summary blockquote

Optional body content (no headings)

## Section Name                      <- H2 sections with file lists

- [Link title](url): Optional notes

## Optional                          <- Special: tools may skip this section
                                       for shorter context

- [Link title](url): Secondary info
```

### Key Rules

- File must be valid markdown
- H1 title is the only required element
- Blockquote summary provides key context for understanding the rest
- Body content: any markdown except headings (paragraphs, lists, etc.)
- H2 sections contain file lists: `- [name](url): description`
- `## Optional` has semantic meaning: tools may skip it for shorter context
- Designed for on-demand/inference-time use, not crawling or training

### File Naming and Location

| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| `/llms.txt` | Primary index at site root |
| `/llms-full.txt` | Expanded version with all pages |
| `page.html.md` | Markdown version of individual pages |
| `llms-ctx.txt` | Generated expanded context (no URLs) |
| `llms-ctx-full.txt` | Generated expanded context (with URLs) |

### Relationship to Other Standards

- **robots.txt**: Governs crawler access; llms.txt provides content context
  (complementary)
- **sitemap.xml**: Lists all indexable pages; llms.txt curates a focused,
  LLM-sized subset

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

## Example Project Implementation

### Template

A template file (e.g., `.github/templates/llms.txt.tpl`) holds curated markdown with a `${BLOB}` placeholder for GitHub blob URLs. A typical implementation has 5 H2 sections and ~17 links.

### Workflows

**Generation workflow** (e.g., `write-llms-txt.yaml`) — Generates `docs/llms.txt` from template:

1. Validates all template links point to existing files
2. Substitutes `${BLOB}` with `github.com/{repo}/blob/main`
3. Commits `docs/llms.txt` if changed
4. Triggers on push to `main` when docs/src/template change

**Deploy workflow** (e.g., `deploy-docs.yaml`) — Deploys docs site:

1. Copies `docs/llms.txt` to `site/llms.txt` at site root
2. Serves raw llms.txt at the documentation site root per spec

### Example Template Sections

| Section | Links | Coverage |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| Getting Started | 3 | README, contributing guide, agent rules |
| Architecture & Design | 3 | architecture doc, user stories, roadmap |
| Usage & Operations | 2 | usage guide, troubleshooting |
| Best Practices | 4 | system design, security, testing, language conventions |
| Optional | 5 | Security advisories, CC analysis, landscape research |

## Relevance for CC Research

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Documentation Area | Fit | Rationale |
| ------------------ | --- | --------- |
| Agent SDK | Strong | Foundation for understanding CC agent orchestration and subagent architecture |
| Batch Processing | Strong | 50% cost reduction for evaluation runs |
| CC Analytics API | Strong | Programmatic cost/usage data for CC baseline evaluation |
| Structured Outputs | Moderate | API-level reference for debugging structured output issues |
| Eval Tool | Moderate | Anthropic's own evaluation tooling for comparison |
| Skills API | Moderate | Programmatic skill management if adopting CC plugins |

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

### Priority Research Queue

1. **Batch Processing** — Evaluate for bulk LLM calls (50% cost savings)
2. **CC Analytics API** — Programmatic alternative to manual cost tracking
3. **Agent SDK Subagents** — Subagent architecture and delegation patterns
4. **Eval Tool** — Compare Anthropic's evaluation approach with custom pipelines

### Improvement Opportunities (project llms.txt)

- [ ] Add `llms-full.txt` companion (following platform.claude.com pattern)
- [ ] Add descriptions to links (currently most have none)
- [ ] Add section for autonomous development loop documentation
- [ ] Add blockquote summary (spec recommends it)
