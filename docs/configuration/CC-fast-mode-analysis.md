**Status**: Research preview (pricing and availability may change)

## What Fast Mode Is

A high-speed API configuration for Opus 4.6 — **same model, same quality, 2.5x faster output tokens** ([source][cc-fast]). Toggle with `/fast` in CLI or VS Code. Not a different model or reduced reasoning — purely an infrastructure-level latency optimization at higher per-token cost.

### Pricing

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

| Mode | Input (MTok) | Output (MTok) |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Fast mode Opus 4.6 (<200K context) | $30 | $150 |
| Fast mode Opus 4.6 (>200K context) | $60 | $225 |
| Standard Opus 4.6 | Lower | Lower |

([source][cc-fast])

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

Compatible with the 1M token extended context window ([source][cc-fast]). As of v2.1.50, Opus 4.6 in fast mode includes the full 1M context window.

### Effort Level Interaction (v2.1.68+)

Opus 4.6 defaults to **medium effort** for Max/Team subscribers (v2.1.68). The "ultrathink" keyword was reintroduced for forcing high effort. This interacts with fast mode:

| Combination | Effect |
| ----------- | ------ |
| Fast mode + default (medium) effort | Balanced speed/quality, lower cost than high effort |
| Fast mode + high effort ("ultrathink") | Maximum quality, highest cost and latency |
| Fast mode + low effort | Maximum speed on simple tasks |

After `/extra-usage`, `/fast` remains available (v2.1.37).

### Configuration

```json
{ "fastMode": true }
```

Or toggle per-session: `/fast` (persists across sessions). CLI flag: `--fast`.

### Key Mechanics

- Enabling mid-conversation pays full uncached input price for entire context (enable at session start for cost efficiency) ([source][cc-fast])
- Separate rate limits from standard Opus 4.6; auto-fallback to standard on limit hit ([source][cc-fast])
- Extra usage only — not included in subscription rate limits ([source][cc-fast])
- Not available on Bedrock, Vertex AI, or Azure Foundry ([source][cc-fast])
- Teams/Enterprise: admin must explicitly enable ([source][cc-fast])

### Fast Mode vs Effort Level

| Setting | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| Fast mode | Same quality, lower latency, higher cost |
| Lower effort | Less thinking, faster, potentially lower quality on complex tasks |

Combinable: fast mode + lower effort for maximum speed on simple tasks.

## Applicability

| Workflow | Fit | Rationale |
| -------- | --- | --------- |
| Interactive development (debugging, iteration) | Strong | Latency reduction directly improves developer flow |
| Autonomous headless loop (`claude -p`) | Weak | Developer not waiting; cost matters more than speed |
| Parallel autonomous tasks | Weak | Same as above; multiple concurrent agents multiply the cost further |
| Batch/background generation tasks | Weak | No interactive waiting; cost efficiency preferred |
| Time-boxed collection runs | Neutral | Faster turnaround but 2x+ cost; only worth it under time pressure |

### Decision Rule

**Enable fast mode for interactive sessions where latency breaks flow. Disable for autonomous/headless invocations (`claude -p`) where cost efficiency matters.**

### Potential Integration

If adopted, fast mode could be passed through Makefile recipes:

```makefile
# Example (NOT implemented — YAGNI until measured need)
FAST_MODE ?= false
autonomous_run:
    $(if $(filter true,$(FAST_MODE)),--fast)
```

**Recommendation**: Do not integrate yet. Fast mode is a research preview with unstable pricing. Headless CC usage (`claude -p`) is autonomous — the 2.5x speed gain doesn't justify 2x+ cost increase when no human is waiting. Revisit if:

1. Pricing stabilizes and drops
2. The autonomous loop becomes interactive (unlikely by design)
3. Time-boxed runs need faster turnaround
